						    <h2 class="major">Statement of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h2>
						    <section class="features">
						      <p><font size="+1">In order to create a thriving and interactive research environment for physics collaboration, it is fundamental to ensure that all have a sense of belonging. Only through a diverse, safe environment can students and peers truly be creative and collaborate freely on complex problems in physics research. Through deliberate and conscious efforts to bring equity, intentionally valuing and uplifting the ideas and experiences that all collaborators bring from their diverse backgrounds, one can create a prosperous research environment. Active implementation of anti-racism techniques and inclusionary practices will ensure that all participants are celebrated for their differences in race, cultural backgrounds, religious beliefs, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, physical abilities, and gender identity. Embracing each difference will provide a robust and diverse research and teaching environment that will cultivate the best experience of all QCD Evolution workshop particpants.
